* Intro
  This is a best attempt on a one-person hack in Junction 2018.
  The goal was to provide a new way how to get threat/security intel.

* How does it work? (How is is supposed to?)
  There is a pool of online sources where to look for information for a query
  (currently only Google Search and Google News, scrapers for CVE databases
  social media and fora are/were intended.

  The backend visits links provided to it and tries to extract their plain text.
  The text is then analyzed for entities such as names of software, protocols,
  organisations and other parties.

  Results are then correlated, trimmed and displayed.

* Installation
  Cloning the repo, installing requirements and running Django (=python manage.py runserver=).
  Interfaces can be then visited on [[localhost:8000/v1]] and [[localhost:8000/v2]].
